# 🔧 Firebase Import Error - FIXED!

## What Was Wrong

Firebase v12+ requires type imports to use the `type` keyword. This has been fixed!

## ✅ Changes Made

### 1. Fixed `services/auth.ts`

```typescript
// BEFORE (❌ Error)
import { User, UserCredential } from "firebase/auth";

// AFTER (✅ Fixed)
import { type User, type UserCredential } from "firebase/auth";
```

### 2. Fixed `hooks/useAuth.ts`

```typescript
// BEFORE (❌ Error)
import { User, onAuthStateChanged } from "firebase/auth";
import { getUserData, UserData } from "../services/auth";

// AFTER (✅ Fixed)
import { type User, onAuthStateChanged } from "firebase/auth";
import { getUserData, type UserData } from "../services/auth";
```

### 3. Removed Analytics (Optional)

- Removed `getAnalytics` to avoid potential browser issues
- Analytics can be added later if needed

## 🚀 How to Fix Your Dev Server

### Option 1: Restart Dev Server (Recommended)

```bash
# Stop the current dev server (Ctrl+C or Cmd+C)
# Then run:
cd /Users/amannindra/Projects/AI/web
npm run dev
```

### Option 2: Clear Vite Cache + Restart

```bash
# Stop the dev server
cd /Users/amannindra/Projects/AI/web

# Clear Vite cache
rm -rf node_modules/.vite

# Restart dev server
npm run dev
```

### Option 3: Fresh Install (If still having issues)

```bash
cd /Users/amannindra/Projects/AI/web

# Remove node_modules and reinstall
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
npm run dev
```

## 📝 About the Other Errors

The other errors you saw are **NOT** from our code:

```
❌ SiteBlocker.DW3j6J-E.js - Browser extension
❌ vendor.D7tFNwJo.js - Browser extension
❌ charts.DVMNRrDf.js - Browser extension
❌ runtime.lastError - Browser extension
```

These are from Chrome/browser extensions trying to inject scripts. **They won't affect your app!**

## ✅ After Restarting

Your app should now work perfectly:

1. ✅ No Firebase import errors
2. ✅ Sign up works
3. ✅ Sign in works
4. ✅ Protected routes work
